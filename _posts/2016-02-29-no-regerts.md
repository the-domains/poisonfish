## No Regerts: The Game of Art and Poor Life Choices 

The goal of No Regerts is to simply be the most badass at the end of the game.  To do this, each player must cover their body with sick tattoos. But be careful,  it's not as easy as it sounds. As with real tattoos, there are some that are epic and some that are lame. And with your fellow player attempting to give you bad advice on every turn, you may end up with a few unfortunate tribals. Will you become the ultimate badass? Or will you be left with regerts?
